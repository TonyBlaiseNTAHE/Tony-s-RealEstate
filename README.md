## Real Estate Management Application

This project is a modern web application for managing real estate properties, originally built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js). In this version, the backend has been re-implemented using Spring Boot, leveraging its robust features for REST API development, security, and database management.

- User Authentication: Secure login and registration functionality.
- Search and Filter: Search for properties based on specific criteria.
- Admin Panel: Manage user roles and property listings.
- Responsive UI: Built with React for seamless user experiences on all devices.

### Tech Stack

- Material-UI: For UI components and styling.

## Backend
- Spring Boot: For building RESTful APIs.
- Spring Security: For user authentication and role management.
