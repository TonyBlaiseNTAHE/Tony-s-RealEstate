## Real Estate Management Application

This project is a modern web application for managing real estate properties, originally built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js). In this version, the backend has been re-implemented using Spring Boot, leveraging its robust features for REST API development, security, and database management.
